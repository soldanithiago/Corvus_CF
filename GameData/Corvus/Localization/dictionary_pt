		#corvus_exterior_title           = Cápsula de Comando "Corvus"
		#corvus_exterior_description     = The command pod of the Corvus program was designed by brothers Pollux and Castor Kerman in an attemt to allow more of Kerbalkind to come together in space and study shiny objects. The large viewports and simple design makes training to dock in space easier. Several programs have adapted spare pods for unconventional uses to save costs.

		#corvus_nose_title               = Cone de Nariz "Corvus"
		#corvus_nose_description         = By throwing a docking port, a parachute, and a bunch of RCS thrusters into a big pot and stirring it, Reaction Systems was able to accidently create a useful part. The RCS system allows the pod to reorient itself during reentry protocols.

		#corvus_supply_title             = Tanque de Suprimentos "Corvus"
		#corvus_supply_description       = The Corvus spacecraft's main supply tank carries a substantial amount of monopropellant. A small monopropellant generator has been added, after the tragic events of Corvus I, wherein the crew had to resort to a few somewhat unfavourable body heat saving techniques after losing main power.

		#corvus_oas_title                = Sistema de Atitude Orbital O-20
		#corvus_oas_description          = The O-20 "OAS" was first developed for the Corvus program. This combination RCS system and engine provides a simplistic approach for basic orbital maneuvers by only requiring monopropellant. The main engine is tied to the SAS system and can be pulsed as if it were a normal RCS thruster for docking operations.
